This is my Dissertation product. It's a website that serves the purpose of having a productivity tracker, financial tracker and diet tracker built into one, as not many applications do that. It will requre NPM for it work, I couldn't upload the files due to it being too large.
The frontend was coded using React and Tailwind CSS.

The backend made use of PHP, Firebase JWT and an SQLite databse for users and conference data.

You are able to navigate the website using the buttons at the top. To login to the website you will have to use the emails and passwords from the TOKEN endpoint. Logging in will give you access to the notes of the specific user, while also being able to create new notes, edit notes, and delete them.
